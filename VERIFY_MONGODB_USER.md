# 🔍 Verify MongoDB Atlas User

## Current Issue
Authentication is still failing with username `vibe_db_user` and password `vibe9099`.

---

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Check if User Exists

1. Go to: https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Log in
3. Click **"Database Access"** in left sidebar
4. Look for user: `vibe_db_user`

**If user DOES NOT exist:**
- Go to Step 2 (Create New User)

**If user EXISTS:**
- Go to Step 3 (Reset Password)

---

### Step 2: Create New User (if doesn't exist)

1. Click **"Add New Database User"**
2. Authentication Method: **Password**
3. Username: `vibe_admin` (new username)
4. Password: `vibe9099` (or click Autogenerate)
5. **IMPORTANT:** Copy the password!
6. Database User Privileges: **"Atlas admin"** or **"Read and write to any database"**
7. Click **"Add User"**
8. Wait 1 minute

**Then tell me:**
- New username: `vibe_admin`
- New password: (the one you set)

---

### Step 3: Reset Password (if user exists)

1. Find `vibe_db_user` in the list
2. Click **"Edit"** button
3. Click **"Edit Password"**
4. Enter password: `vibe9099`
5. Click **"Update User"**
6. Wait 1 minute

---

### Step 4: Verify User Permissions

1. Find your user in the list
2. Check "Built-in Role" column
3. Should say: **"Read and write to any database"** or **"Atlas admin"**

**If it says something else:**
1. Click **"Edit"**
2. Change to: **"Read and write to any database"**
3. Click **"Update User"**

---

### Step 5: Double-Check Network Access

1. Click **"Network Access"** in left sidebar
2. Should see: **0.0.0.0/0** (Allow access from anywhere)

**If not:**
1. Click **"Add IP Address"**
2. Click **"Allow Access from Anywhere"**
3. Click **"Confirm"**
4. Wait 1 minute

## Alternative: Create Fresh User

Let's start fresh with a new user:

1. Go to **"Database Access"**
2. Click **"Add New Database User"**
3. Username: `vibes_admin`
4. Password: Click **"Autogenerate Secure Password"**
5. **COPY THE PASSWORD** (very important!)
6. Privileges: **"Atlas admin"**
7. Click **"Add User"**

**Then tell me:**
```
Username: vibes_admin
Password: [the autogenerated password]
```

---

## What to Tell Me

After you've done the above, tell me ONE of these:

**Option A: Fixed existing user**
```
I reset the password for vibe_db_user to vibe9099
```

**Option B: Created new user**
```
Username: vibes_admin
Password: [your new password]
```

## Common Issues

### Password Has Special Characters
If your password has `@`, `#`, `$`, etc., they need to be URL encoded:
- `@` → `%40`
- `#` → `%23`
- `$` → `%24`

### User Permissions Wrong
User must have "Read and write to any database" or "Atlas admin"

### IP Not Whitelisted
Must have 0.0.0.0/0 in Network Access

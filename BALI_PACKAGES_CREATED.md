## 📄 About the PDFs

### What Happened to the PDFs?

Your original PDFs are still in the `pdfs/` folder. I created **HTML versions** of the packages instead because:

1. **Better User Experience** - Users can browse packages directly on the website
2. **SEO Friendly** - Search engines can index the content
3. **Mobile Responsive** - Works perfectly on all devices
4. **Interactive** - Users can book directly from the package page
5. **Faster Loading** - No need to download PDFs

### PDF Download Option (Optional)

If you still want users to download PDFs:

1. **Manually copy PDFs** to `backend/brochures/` folder:
   - Rename `✨ Bali @ 25000 ✨.pdf` → `bali-budget-25000.pdf`
   - Rename `✨ Bali @ 27000 ✨.pdf` → `bali-standard-27000.pdf`
   - Rename `✨ Bali @ 30000 ✨.pdf` → `bali-deluxe-30000.pdf`
   - Rename `✨ Bali @ 35000 ✨.pdf` → `bali-premium-35000.pdf`

2. **PDFs will automatically link** to packages (already configured in database)

3. **Download buttons will appear** on package detail pages
